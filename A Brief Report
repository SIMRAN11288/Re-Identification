APPROACH
1. Object Detection using YOLOv8 model ( best.pt )
YOLO detects objects frame-by-frame
2. Object Tracking using DEEPSORT
DeepSORT assigns and maintains identities for those objects across frames

METHODOLOGY
1. Object Detection with YOLOv8
Technique: Single-stage, anchor-free object detection
Output: For each frame, bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class IDs
Why YOLOv8?
Fast and accurate
Robust to real-world scenes
Easy to integrate with Ultralytics library

2. Object Tracking with DeepSORT
Technique: Multi-object tracking
Output: Consistent ID for each detected object across frames (e.g., Player 1 stays Player 1)

3.Integration Pipeline
Loop through video frame -> apply YOLO -> convert boxes [x,y,w,h] to frames for DeepSort -> Track with DeepSort -> Each frame + Id -> Output Video
